Final project for the Supervised Learning 2022-2 class, at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), in its ENES Morelia Campus, as part of its Bs. in Data Science career plan.

## Introduction 
Depression is a very present problem in today's society. Various factors of social, cultural, economic and other nature have a strong influence on the possibility of developing depression in different population groups. In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing various metrics on the living conditions of rural residents and their relationship to depression. Based on the different characteristics (gender, income, expenses, number of children, etc.), after applying two different machine learning methods (KNN and logistic regression), we will be able to infer which of them will develop depression and then compare the results and select the most appropriate one given the data.


## Project

The complete project is included in the .pdf file of this repository, as well as the .ipynb file of Jupyter Notebook, which contains all the source code.
