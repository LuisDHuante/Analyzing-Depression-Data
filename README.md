This project consists of the comparison of 2 methods of supervised machine learning, Linear Regression and KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) in the prediction of the presence of depression in inhabitants of rural areas.

## Introduction 
Today, depression is a very present problem
in today's society. Various factors of a social nature,
cultural, economic, among others, strongly influence the
possibility of different population sectors to develop
depression. In this project we will analyze a set of data
which contains various metrics concerning the conditions
of life of the inhabitants of rural areas and their relationship with
the Depression. Through the different characteristics (sex,
income, expenses, number of children, etc), we can infer which
of them will have depression after the application of 2
of the different machine learning methods (KNN and
Logistic Regression), to subsequently compare results
each other and choose the fittest given the given data.
