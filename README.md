## Affiliation
Final project for the Supervised Learning class at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), in its ENES Morelia Campus, as part of its B.S. in Data Science career plan.

## Introduction
In this project, we explore the use of various supervised machine learning models to classify celestial objects into categories such as galaxies, stars, and quasars. Utilizing a dataset with both photometric and spectral features, we performed an exploratory analysis followed by preprocessing and hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of different models and determine which provided the best classification performance.

## Project
The full project is available in the .pdf file of this repository, along with the .ipynb file from Jupyter Notebook, which contains all the source code.

## Abstract
This project applies several machine learning models, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and an ensemble method based on a Voting Classifier, to classify celestial objects. After conducting an exploratory analysis and preprocessing the data, hyperparameter tuning was performed via GridSearchCV. The results demonstrated that the ensemble model outperformed the individual models in terms of precision and F1-Score, highlighting the effectiveness of ensemble techniques for enhancing classification accuracy.
