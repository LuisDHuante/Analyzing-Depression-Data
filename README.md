Final Project for the Supervised Learning 2022-2 class, at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), in its ENES Morelia Campus (ENES Morelia), as part of its Bs. in Data Science career plan.

## Introduction 
Today, depression is a very present problem in today's society. Various factors of a social nature, cultural, economic, among others, strongly influence the possibility of different population sectors to develop depression. In this project we will analyze a set of data which contains various metrics concerning the conditions of life of the inhabitants of rural areas and their relationship with the Depression. Through the different characteristics (sex, income, expenses, number of children, etc), we can infer which of them will have depression after the application of 2 of the different machine learning methods (KNN and Logistic Regression), to subsequently compare results each other and choose the fittest given the given data.

## Project

The full project is contained in the .pdf file included in this repository, as well as the Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file containing all the source code.
